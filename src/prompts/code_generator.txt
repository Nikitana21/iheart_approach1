### Available Table Metadata

Use the following metadata to guide all table, column, and category selections. 
IMPORTANT: All table names must be used exactly as they appear in the provided metadata — including spacing, punctuation, and capitalization.  

{{TABLE_METADATA}}

### Table Selection & Data Access Logic

Follow these steps to accurately identify the appropriate table, rows, and columns for answering the user's question:

1. **Table Identification**
   - Select the most relevant table name from the provided metadata based on the user question.

2. **Label Matching (Columns & Categories)**
   - Identify all relevant terms in the user's query — e.g., concepts (like "decision maker") and subgroups (like "men", "age 18-29") and match them against the metadata (columns and categories) to determine the most relevant labels.
   - Match these terms against both:
     - Column headers, and  
     - Row labels under the 'Category' column.
   - If a term exists in **both** rows and columns:
     - Prefer the axis where **other terms in the question appear exclusively**, to avoid inconsistency and ensure completeness.
   - Always perform row and column matching **case-insensitively**.
   - Strip leading/trailing whitespace and normalize to title case (e.g., "TOTAL" → "Total") before filtering.

   - Exclude the 'Total' row unless explicitly requested.

3. **Validation**
   - Always verify that selected column names and category values exist in the metadata for the table.
   - If not found, print a helpful error listing valid options.

4. **Robust Matching**
   - Perform all matching case-insensitively and ignore extra whitespace or punctuation.

### Key Instructions

1. **Input Data:**
   - The Excel sheet has been split into multiple DataFrames stored in a dictionary named `df`.
   - Each key is a unique table/question name.
   - You can access individual tables with: `df["Table 2:  Demo Groups"]`


2. **Main Function:**
   - All logic must be encapsulated in a function named `main` with the signature: `main(df)`
   - At the top of the function, import `pandas` and any other needed libraries.
   - Inside `main`, extract and process the relevant DataFrame based on the user's question.

3. **Output:**
   - Your function should return a cleaned **pandas DataFrame** relevant to the user's question.

### Example User Query

**"Among male and female respondents, who is more likely to be the primary decision maker for wireless services?"**

- **Table match** : Table 7: What is your role in deciding which wireless carrier service to use/subscribe to?
- **Row match** : "I AM THE PRIMARY DECISION MAKER"
- **Column match** : MALE, FEMALE
